                                <p>I was contracted by <a href="https://myendlesspool.com/">MyEndlessPool</a> to rebuild their PrestaShop backend as in it's current state it was not able to be upgraded due to database issues and plugin conflicts. I had to create a few scripts using python to migrate the data over to a fresh install of the newest version of PrestaShop as well as tweak and reinstall all necessary plugins.</p>

                                <p>I created an extension for Chrome to streamline recording and directly uploading videos orginally built for a website created for education content. The extension used authentication to upload directly to the users account. The user could record using a webcam that would be overlayed of the screen, just the screen, or just the camera.</p>

                                <p>Languages/Technologies: PHP, SQL, XML</p>
                                <p>I created a backend web server for a Doordash like service to interact with the Epson tm-t88vi thermal printer API to delegate print jobs to multiple remote restaurants using polling to avoid network conflicts. This enabled printers to be set up without requiring port forwarding or advance networking. My backend would take print jobs and format them into the expected XML format required of the API. After it would take poll request from each printer, match the print job to their ID and send off the print job</p>

                                <p>This project was two part: one was a payment processor that emailed virtual keys to be redeemed through a Discord bot; the other being the Discord bot itself. The discord bot handled key generation/redemptions, removing access after key expiration, and as well a support system.</p>

                                <p>I created a multithreaded bot that would monitor the stock of popular websites and post stock updates through webhooks using JSON. You could subscribe to stock updates by inputting a SKU for each item which then it would scrape the API of each site and post a notification on any change. </p>

                                <p>This project was from an insurance company that needed to automate inputting their timesheets created in Microsoft Spreadsheet to their new online system using <a href="https://www.sageintacct.com/">Sage Intacct</a>. There was not an official API at the time so the only way to do so was through key input emulation.</p>
